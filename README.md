# Linear Regression Calculator
This is a simple web-based Linear Regression Calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to input pairs of data points and calculates the best-fit linear equation using the least squares method. The result includes the equation of the line and a visual plot of the data points along with the regression line.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The calculator features a clean, responsive design with an attractive green-blue gradient theme.

2. **Input Validation**: The app validates the input to ensure that the user provides valid data points before performing calculations.

3. **Interactive Hover Effects**: Interactive elements like the text area, buttons, and canvas have hover effects, enhancing the user experience.

4. **Real-Time Plotting**: After calculating the regression, the calculator plots the data points and the best-fit line on a canvas.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download the files and open the **'index.html'** file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Input Data**: Enter your data points in the text area. Each data point should be in the format x,y, with one point per line. For example:

    1,2

    2,3

    3,5

    4,4

    5,6

2. **Calculate Regression**: Click the "Calculate Regression" button to calculate the best-fit linear equation.

3. **View Results**: The equation of the regression line will be displayed, and the data points along with the regression line will be plotted on the canvas below.

4. **Error Handling**: If no values are entered or if the values are not in the correct format, an error message will be displayed prompting the user to enter valid values.

## Files

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the calculator.

2. **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the calculator, including the gradient background, hover effects, and layout.

3. **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for calculating the linear regression, validating inputs, and plotting the data.
